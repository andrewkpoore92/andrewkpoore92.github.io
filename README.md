<h2>My Portfolio</h1>
<p>Here I used basic HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript functions, to create a site for myself, showing off what I have worked on and learned about while attending The Tech Academy. Here you will find content and styling done through and HTML and CSS, and a slideshow and contact form created using JavaScript. The site also links to The Tech Academy's home page, my personal GitHub page, and my portfolio within GitHub.</p>

<h2>Iceland Project</h1>
<p>Here I used basic HTML and CSS to create a fake travel site for trips to Iceland, complete with CSS styling, a navbar, image containers, and a contact form.</p>

<h2>Cinema Project</h1>
<p>In this project, I utilized Bootstrap 4 to make a home page for a movie theater. It also incluses a navbar, as well as a jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.</p>
