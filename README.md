<h1>Final HTML and CSS portfolio</h1>
<p>These are the projects I made while going through Tech Academy's HTML and CSS course, as well as the Front End Development & Security Course.</p>

<h2>Iceland Project</h1>
<p>Here I used basic HTML and CSS to create a fake travel site for trips to Iceland, complete with CSS styling, a navbar, image containers, and a contact form.</p>

<h2>Cinema Project</h1>
<p>In this project, I utilized Bootstrap 4 to make a home page for a movie theater. It also incluses a navbar, as well as a jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.</p>
